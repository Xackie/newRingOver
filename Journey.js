      <h3>THE ROOTS</h3>
      <p>Our entire life when we shop, we are linited by choices that are there in a store. We are often on the side
        where we buy our favourite coloured shoes made by someone else but what if we designed it? What if we could involve
        in the making of a shoe we want to buy? This little thought sprouted to become what we are today, KIKSUP!;)
      </p>
      <h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
      <p>Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users think when they buy were our top priorities before we moved further in the building. After weeks of
        fruitful research, we stepped into the user's shoes and look at what we plan to do. It's a great joy for the users if they are involved in the making. We're heading into an era of technology and 
        people prefer online shopping in an outlet.
      </p>
      <h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>
      <p>Every milestone begins with a single step and before KICKSUP sprounted,
        the team manufactured in small scale with two users a month. This experience was
        crucial to our brand as this is our first practical experience. Interacting with the users was the best thing ever. The positive reviews
         and support from people motivated us to push our linits further.</p>
      <h3>KICKSUP</h3>
      <p>
        Here we are, made a perfect platform for you to involve in the making of a
        shoe you want to buy! We have evolved since we started out. We wish to help you
         more and make KICKSUP a bigger team. Design your shoe and be a part of our journey!
